# Emotion Detection - Naan Mudhalvan Project

This project is developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan** skill development program under the subject **OpenCV**. It aims to detect human emotions from **facial images** using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

##  Introduction

Emotion detection is a powerful application of artificial intelligence that analyzes **facial expressions** to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more. This project processes facial images, detects facial features using OpenCV, and uses a trained machine learning model to predict the emotional state.


##  Project Structure

* `Project1.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for image processing, face detection, feature extraction, and emotion classification.
* `README.md` – Project documentation.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* OpenCV (image processing and face detection)
* Scikit-learn (ML models)
* NumPy & Pandas (data handling)
* Matplotlib (visualization)

## How to Run

1. Open the project in Google Colab:

   * [Click here to open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SharamRiyaA/Emotion-Detection/blob/main/Project1.ipynb)

2. Make sure to upload or connect necessary image files as needed.

3. Run all cells in the notebook to detect emotions from facial images.

## Future Enhancements

* Improve accuracy with a larger and more diverse image dataset.
* Add support for real-time webcam-based emotion detection.
* Integrate the model into a web or mobile interface.
